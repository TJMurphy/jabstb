# Installing and Understanding the software {#software}

*When you buy commerical, GUI-based software, you're mostly paying for a silky smooth install experience. R and RStudio is free. -anonymous*

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(swirl)
library(tidyverse)
```

Download and install R and RStudio separately, and in that order. 

## Spring 2020 term versions

R: 3.6.2 "Dark and Stormy Night"

RStudio: 1.2.1335

I'll tell you where to get them below.

### What are these?

R is the computational engine. When you feed R some script, it produces output.

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier than alternatives. 

RStudio helps you work with documents that have R code. 

### Rule 1: Install R first, install RStudio second

This will make it easier for RStudio to automagically "find" your R installation.

### Rule 2: Don't pay!

One sign you are doing it wrong is when you find yourself about to purchase something. Step away if that's the case. These are free.

### Rule 3: Don't compile!

A second sign you are doing it wrong is if you are compiling source code. Unless you really really really know what you are doing, don't compile 'source'. Only use the installers, which install the 'binaries'.

### Rule 4: Install the right software for your machine

Note for Windows users: If you have a 64bit processor, it is a very good idea to install and run the 64bit R version.

### Rule 5: Use this installation guide

Now go to [this link](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-install-r-on-mac-ubuntu-and-windows-2/), find your machine system, and follow the directions therein.

## After installation

Launch only RStudio on your machine. You don't need to launch the R. RStudio should be able to find your R installation and will run that.

You will see the R console as one of the panes in R studio. On the prompt (`>`) line, type either `2+2`, `2^2`, `16/4` or `2*2`. If you get `4` with any of these you are good to go. 

### What is R?

R is an open source computing environment and object oriented programming language, useful for a wide assortment of data analysis projects. This semester you will work with R from within R Studio. R Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) what makes working with R much easier

Here's an extremely helpful analogy.

The late PBS personality Bob Ross was driven to teach others how to create beautiful oil landscapes. You are driven to analyze data. 

Bob Ross has an easel. You have RStudio.

Bob Ross has a palette. You have R.

Bob Ross has many types of paint brushes. You have R packages.

Bob Ross has different types of paints and colors. You have the R functions, which are inside R packages.

Bob Ross paints on different types of canvas. You'll write and share your work involving R code in different file formats (R Script,  R Markdown, Shiny and more).

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=3, fig.cap ="You and Bob Ross have much in common."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bobross11-1395763361.jpg")
```

### R packages

Packages are created by R users who share them with other users. From time to time you'll install these packages, for free. You'll find packages in repositories (CRAN, Github, etc).

A package is a collection of pre-built functions suited for a specific purpose. When you want to accomplish some task with your own data, there is a pretty good chance someone wrote a function that will to that for you. If they did, it is in some package. 

Packages have help pages and/or vignettes and even example data sets that illustrate how to use its functions.

#### System and user packages

There are two types of packages, system or user.

To see these, after installing R and then R Studio, on the top menu go to View > Show Packages (or use Ctrl+7 on your keyboard while in RStudio). Or in one of your R Studio panes you'll see a `Packages` thumbnail.

The packages in the system library come along with your R installation. These are often referred to as the base packages. In the user library are the packages you install on your machine. The user library will grow over time. As you do more things with R, you'll find more uses for all sorts of additional packages. 

You may even create a package of your own. A custom package you write can be useful for common functions and tasks that you use your own work.

After you update to the next version of R you'll need to reinstall updated versions of all of the user packages you'll want to use. Unlike commerical software, that's not an automagic process with an R update. Furthermore, sometimes functions in a given package may have conflicts with older and newer versions of R.

**For this reason, during the course I want everybody working with the same R version. Don't use a prior version. And don't upgrade to the next version if one comes out during the semester.**

#### Installing and using R packages

This is really important.

Whenever you need to install a package that you are missing, say, the `foobar` package, go to the console. Next to the `>` prompt, type the command `install.packages("foobar")` and then hit enter. R will search for the package on an internet repository, download it, and install it.

You only need to install a given package once when working with a given R version. 

If it is a package you use often, you only need to reinstall the package when you upgrade to the next R version.

By itself, installing a package doesn't make it available for use. Whenever you need to use functions within an installed user library package, you must first load it into your working environment during your current R session. Use the `library` function for this. 

For example, typing  `library(foobar)` in the console will load the `foobar` package in your environment. The functions within `foobar` that you want to use will now be available. They will remain present in your environment until you clear the environment. For example, by shutting down and restarting R.

Notice the installation command uses quotes `""` whereas the load library command does not.

The packages in the system library don't need to be called into the environment. Their functions work automagically.

For this book, at the beginning of each chapter I list the packages that will be necessary to run the scripts within that chapter. In order for you to run my scripts, you will first need to install those packages on your machine and load their library once in a R session.

**Remember, you install a package only once. After that, the package and its function are stored on your machine. Whenever you need to use the package (or a function(s) within it) for the current session, you will need to load it into your environment using the `library()` command**

## Important: Avoid compiling

When installing R or R packages you are sometimes presented with the option of compiling the package from source code. For example, after typing an install package command you might see a trigger message in the console like this:

`Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation (yes/no/cancel)?`

*In almost all cases, your selection should be `no`.* 

At which point R will download and install the **binary** version. Binary versions are pre-compiled. With that, you'll probably be fine.

### Reasons not to compile

* No need to make things more complicated when you are starting out
* Compiling tends to lengthen the installation time...often quite dramatically.
* Source code is often developmental, and may have bugs
* Your machine may not be configured to compile properly (eg, your JRE version is out of date) 

Compiling **might** make it harder for you to perform the required tasks for this course. 

As your R experience and skills grow, down the road you'll likely want to use packages you need to compile. Wait until then.
