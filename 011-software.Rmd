# Software

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
```

The course requires that you use the latest version of R and also using the RStudio integrated development environment to run R. R and RStudio have to be downloaded and installed separately. 

RStudio simplifies reading, writing and running scripts in R.

R itself is a collection of packages. Individual packages have the functions that you'll need. Once a package is installed on your machine, you'll need to load its library for those functions to be available for your work.

After installing R you'll have a library of system packages. These are known colloquilly as the "base" packages. The libraries for these base packages are automagically loaded each time you run R. Thus, you won't need to "call" base package librarly prior to running functions within them.

From time to time you'll need to run other functions that are only found in other packages. Over time, you'll create a user library of these packages. Any time you need to get its functions to run you'll need to load the package into your environment using the `library()` function. 

At the beginning of each chapter I list the libraries that will be necessary to run the scripts in that chapter. Those will be packages you'll need to install if you don't have them already.

## My code is your code

I want you to read everything in these chapters, including the R code. Especially the R code. If you're able to see the code that leads to some output, that means I think it is important for you to understand that code, how it works. You'll need it as a basis to write your own custom scripts...for class work, home work, and beyond.

If you are new to R, at first it will seem...unintelligible. But it will make sense to you with a bit of time.

The other stuff I've written in the chapters is about statistics. Understanding the code is no less important than understanding the statistics.

## Install R and RStudio

Installation of R and RStudio is pretty straight forward but not idiot proof. One sign you are doing it wrong is when you find yourself about to purchase something. Step away if that's the case. These are free. 

A second sign you are doing it wrong (unless you really know what you are doing) is if you are compiling source code.

Note for Windows users: If you have a 64bit processor, it is a very good idea to install and run the 64bit R version.

To get started do the following **in this sequence**:

1) Step 1. Install version 3.5.2 (Eggshell Igloo) of R. 
* [Go here](https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/). Select the appropriate precompiled binary distribution for your machine. Unless you know what you're doing, don't select the source code.

2) Step 2. Run the installer function after downloading so that you have a running version of R on your machine

3) Step 3. Install version 1.1.x of RStudio only after you have completed installing R. [Go here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Select the free option and choose the appropriate installer for your platform from the list. In all likelihood, you DO NOT want to choose a zip/tarball or source code.

4) Step 4. Run the RStudio installer so that you have a running version of it.

If you installed R prior to RStudio as instructed, launching RStudio on your machine should automagically configure R to work within the RStudio. 

Poke around with the RStudio menu bar and the RStudio panes. Under `Tools` select `Global Options` and experiment with an appearance configuration to your liking.

## Getting started with R

Once you have R and RStudio up and running a class assignment will be to wrok on the R Programming module in the interactive [swirl package](https://swirlstats.com/). Install and load the swirl library by typing the following into the R console within R studio.

```
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
```
Swirl does a quick overview of the basics. But there are a lot of basics, most of which you'll forget! But that's ok. As you go through swirl I suggest you go to the source pane to open up a fresh R script or R markdown file to take notes (eg, copy/paste code snippets) for a custom cheatsheet.

## Other resources

There are many, many other resources with which to get started. Try some, if you wish.

[If you are ready to roll up your sleaves and play with R go here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-5-most-effective-ways-to-learn-r/).

As you work with R you'll make mistakes. Of these, >90% will be typos, especially missing commas and unclosed parentheses. If you didn't mistype a command, just copy and paste error messages into your browser search bar. Most of the errors you will make have happened before. Most of what you want to do someone has done before. Almost always, the best documented solutions are usually found in StackOverflow.

Code camps are nice, but by far the best way to learn R is to just start using it to solve the problems you need to solve. I'll provide you the problems you need to solve in this course. They are about learning statistics, but you'll end up learning how to use R as a side benefit.

By the way, after you install the `swirl` package, go ahead and install the `tidyverse` package.
