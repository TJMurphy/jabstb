# About the author {#author}

A few years ago I adopted this course from Frank Gordon, a colleague who had retired. Like Frank, I'm a biomedical scientist who happens to have high level of interest in statistical methods. 

I learned this material as a graduate student at Mizzou. There I took several stats courses. The ones with the most impact were taught by the late Gary Krause, then a professor and statistician in Mizzou's agricultural college.

The light turned on for me while taking Gary's *Experimenal Design* course. That's when the fog of mathematical statistics cleared enough so I could finally "get" the pragmatic value of statistics for the researcher. What became most clear is that experimental design is a statistical framework for conducting unbiased research. That concept permeates my course and this book.

I was working on my PhD in pharmacology within the medical school. But most of my classmates in Gary's courses were working on a PhD in one of the agriculture programs, usually in some area of agronomy or in animal science. 

The problem my classmates shared, which was not one that really affected me, is having one growing or mating season by which to run a fully replicated experiment.

One shot.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/my_shot.jpg")
```

That one shot changes everything.

Planning was a priority for them. They needed to map out their experimental design in advance. Once the experiment began, any new wrinkles or oversights would have to wait until the next growing season. They didn't have the luxury of running out to the field to plant another row of the crop, or to arrange additional breeding groups. 

Planning was based upon statistical design principles, often in consultation with Gary. Statistics were *a priori* planning and *post-hoc* tests. At the end of the season the samples were harvested. After all the biochemistry was completed at their lab benches, the final statistical analysis was performed according to the planned approach.

In contrast, it is fair to say that most biomedical scientists fail to incorporate statistical design into their plans. That failure opens up a whole can of worms that can generally be characterized as doing statistics in ways it was never meant to be done.

All too common is the biomedical researchers who takes a more "fly by the seat of their pants" approach to running experiments and collecting data. In this approach, bunches of near and partial replicates are munged together before looking at the results and making a decision about what statistical analysis would be most appropriate to confirm their inclined interpretation.  

Unfortunately, that approach is riddled with biases, and sometimes other negative consequences that are even more challenging.

Experimental statistics was invented by the founders as a means of instilling some structure into the planning, discovery and inference process so that unbiased interpretations can be made.

The focus of this course is in teaching statistics as experimental design. The ideal learner will finish the course knowing how to map out the statistical plan for an experiment in advance and appreciate why this is so important to reduce bias.  

That same learner will also know how to analyze, interpret, visualize, and write up the results for a wide array of experimental designs. Most of which she will forget immediately. 

And since I emphasize pre-planning, this book is full of simulations. That's the really great advantage of using R to teach biostats, in my view.

I'm not a mathematician so I only offer enough theoretical and mathematical statistics to provide a glimpse of how how things work "under the hood". When I do, it is mostly for stuff I think is helpful to interpret statistical output, or illustrate why a test works in a specific way. I very much believe there is an important place for mathematical statistics, I just don't believe I'm the person who should be teaching it.  

Scientists have a lot of overt biases and are the last to realize it. Data frequently has a lot of hidden biases we fail to see. That's why operating within a statistical design framework is so important. 

For the biomedical PhD student hoping to graduate while still young, a statistical design framework also offers potential to keep things rolling downhill for you. Statistical thinking should help you avoid the time-sucking rabbit holes that are associated with sloppy, inconclusive or uninterpretable experiments and prolonged time to degrees.
