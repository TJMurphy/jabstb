This book is a resource for students enrolled in my biostats course. The students are primarily in one of Emory's biomedical and biological sciences PhD programs. There are the ocassional Emory honors program undergrads, students from Emory's public health school, and usually a few Georgia Tech graduate students, also.

When you teach stats you have to choose software and maybe a textbook. For the latter, you can either adopt someone elses textbook, wishing all along it emphasized things better, or just wing it and cover the stuff you think is important. I'd been wrestling with the decision to switch over to R for a few years, but never really found the right book that covered things the way I like to cover things.

But when I finally took the plunge I needed to prepare a bunch of handouts with coding examples for the various types of analyses I'd been teaching. As long as I had those, why not write a few more handouts about the foundations? Before you know it, you have a book.  

This is that. JABSTB. 

Not included in this book are additional materials for the course (eg, take home and group exercises, slide decks, data sets, my extensive collection of stats cartoons, etc). 

The scope of the book is to provide a) some background on statistical fundamentals that are relevant to the biomedical researcher (sampling, error, statistical hypotheses, experimental design) and then, b) provide examples for running and interpreting various statistical functions. 

These are meant to be starting points. What's really nice about R is its adaptability. Copy and paste my examples into your R script or R markdown file, understand how they work, and then get to work modifying them for your own purposes. 

Most chapters have code that require R packages beyond those in base. Those are listed at the head of each chapter.

Each chapter has a corresponding RMarkdown document. If you wish to grab those documents instead of using this material as HTML, go grab it on Github. Simply fork, clone or download them from the [Github jabstb repo](https://github.com/TJMurphy/jabstb). You'll just need the Rmd files. All of the other files are there for publishing this up as bookdown. By the way, I've optimized these Rmd's to make good HTML pages. I have not checked to see if they work as PDFs. 

Just bear in mind, this book is a living document. I expect to subject it to a lot of on-the-fly revision. Stuff will be added and eliminated over time.

As I write these words, in Dec 2018, my main disclaimer is that it is definitely an MVP. If you find errors, have any suggestions, or would otherwise like to contribute, I welcome your help. Just submit a pull request and/or contact me by email.
