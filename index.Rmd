# Preface {-}

This is book intended as a resource for a semester-long biostats course that I teach at Emory University entitled, *Statistical Design and Analysis of Experiments*. Not included in this book are additional materials for the course (eg, take home and group exercises, slide decks, data sets, cartoons, etc).

The audience is (mostly) students in Emory University's interdepartmental biomedical and biological sciences PhD programs. There is the ocassional Emory undergrad, students from Emory's public health school, and usually a few Georgia Tech graduate students. 

Each chapter corresponds to a RMarkdown document. The first few chapters deal with statistical fundamentals that are applicable to all types of statistical analysis. From then on, beginning with a chapter on the statistics of categorical variables, the material covers the statistical analysis of the three main forms that experimental data come in: sorted, ordered and measured data. Those sections illustrate how to analyze a certain kind of data type, within a certain kind of experimental design.

Most of the chapters have R script embedded in code chunks. These scripts generally serve two purposes. The first is to illustrate a statistical principle. The second is as "how to" code, for students to mimic, as they write their own R code to analyze their own data. 

For that reason, the code chunks in the book are admittedly bit long at times. To have the chunks in hand, the reader can download this book from Github. To more conveniently access those RMarkdown documents and all that script. Just bear in mind, this book is a living document and will be subjected to a lot of on-the-fly revision.
