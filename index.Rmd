This book is intended primarily as a resource for students enrolled in a biostats course that I teach by the same title.  The students are primarily in one of Emory's biomedical and biological sciences PhD programs. There are the ocassional Emory honors program undergrads, students from Emory's public health school, and usually a few Georgia Tech graduate students, also.

They'll need this book for the coursework. If they choose to use R as their main analytic tool, perhaps they'll find this book to be a useful resource.

Not included in this book are additional materials for the course (eg, take home and group exercises, slide decks, data sets, my extensive collection of stats cartoons, etc). The basic use for the book is that it has many examples for running and interrpeting various statistical functions. Copy and paste my examples into your R script or R markdown file, and get to work. Every chapter is self-contained with respect to packages. If any are needed to run scripts in a given chapter, they are listed at the top of the chapter. 

Each chapter corresponds to a RMarkdown document. If you wish to grab those documents instead of using this material from HTML, simply fork, clone or download them from the [Github jabstb repo](https://github.com/TJMurphy/jabstb). Just bear in mind, this book is a living document, which I expect to subject to a lot of on-the-fly revision. Stuff will be added and eliminated over time.

As I write these words, in Dec 2018, my main disclaimer is that it is definitely an MVP. If you find errors, have any suggestions, or would otherwise like to contribute, please submit a pull request or contact me by email.
