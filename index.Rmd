This book is assembled as resource for students enrolled in my biostats course at Emory University in Atlanta. They are primarily in one of Emory's biomedical and biological sciences PhD programs. The class usually also includes the occasional Emory honors program undergrads, students from Emory's public health school, and a few Georgia Tech graduate students.

When I finally made the switch to teaching my course in R I needed to prepare a bunch of handouts, essentially handout per statistical model. I did that using R Markdown. Then I decided to write some intro handouts. Then I found [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). Before I knew it, I had a "book". This is that. JABSTB. A collection of handouts.

Not included in this book are additional materials for the course (eg, take home and group exercises, slide decks, data sets, my extensive collection of stats cartoons, etc). 

The scope of the book is to provide some background on statistical fundamentals that are most relevant to the biomedical researcher and to provide examples for running and interpreting various statistical functions. These people test ideas by generating data after manipulating some independent variable(s). They need to know principles of sampling, error, statistical hypotheses, types of data and experimental design. 

Each chapter has a corresponding R Markdown document. If you wish to grab those documents (and any data sets read in those Markdowns) instead of using this material as HTML, go grab it on from the [Github jabstb repo](https://github.com/TJMurphy/jabstb). 

This book is a living document, subject to a lot of on-the-fly revision. Stuff will be added and eliminated over time.

As I edit these words, in Aug 2019, my main disclaimer is that it is definitely an MVP.
