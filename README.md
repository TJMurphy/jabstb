# jabstb

This material is for my "biostats" course at Emory University (read the preface)

JABSTB is very much rough draft state and changes often. Chapters are undergoing revision and new chapters are added from time to time.

At the present time, if you just need the material, I suggest you access the JABSTB contents via the bookdown html: https://tjmurphy.github.io/jabstb/

If you want the documents, use version control. The latest will always be in the master branch.
