# jabstb

This material is for my "biostats" course.

JABSTB is very much rough draft state and changing almost daily. Chapters are undergoing revision and new chapters will be added over the next month or two.

At the present time I suggest you access the JABSTB contents via the bookdown html: https://tjmurphy.github.io/jabstb/

If you want the documents, use version control. The latest will always be in the master branch.
